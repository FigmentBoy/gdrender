# GDrender
Trying to render Geometry Dash levels correctly

# Usage
Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/maxnut/gdrender/releases/latest) tab. Drag the _Resources_ folder from your Geometry Dash copy into the program's folder

Run GD.exe, search for levels and click open. Press P to start the level, w and s for scrolling up and down

Press ESC to go back to the level select screen

__Levels will probably have some incorrect parts__
